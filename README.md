# -Modified-Arithmetic-Coding-to-Increase-the-Compression-Rate-of-Text-Data
Modified arithmetic coding improves compression rates for  text data by optimizing encoding algorithms.
Decimal point compression used in encoding text data enhances compression efficiency.
Resultant compression achieves higher rates compared to conventional arithmetic coding techniques.
